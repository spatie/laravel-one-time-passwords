## From v1 to v2

There are no breaking changes in v2. You can upgrade from v1 to v2 without making any changes to your code.

v2 adds automatic detection of [Flux](https://fluxui.dev). When Flux is installed, the Livewire component will use the [Flux OTP input component](https://fluxui.dev/components/otp-input) for an enhanced user experience.

If you don't have Flux installed, the package will continue to use the default text input, just like in v1.
