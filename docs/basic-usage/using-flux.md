title: Using Flux
weight: 6

When [Flux](https://fluxui.dev) is installed, the Livewire component will automatically use the [Flux OTP input component](https://fluxui.dev/components/otp-input).

You can install Flux by following the instructions on their website: [https://fluxui.dev](https://fluxui.dev)

Once Flux is installed, the package will automatically detect it and use the Flux OTP input component instead of the default text input.
